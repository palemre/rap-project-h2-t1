# L'Histoire du Rap

L'Histoire du Rap :fr: is a project leaded by HETIC students (a well-known french web school), within no more than 10 days. This project have been done as a subject to reflexion on History. According to the creator's, history's problem is how it is learned and accessed. That's why we chose one specific historical subject, rap music, and delayed rap's history through an immersive website.
