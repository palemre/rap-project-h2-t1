# L'Histoire du Rap

L'Histoire du Rap is a project leaded by HETIC students (a well-known french web school), within no more than 10 days. This project have been done as a subject to reflexion on History. According to the creator's, history's problem is how it is learned and accessed. That's why they chose one specific historical subject, rap music, and delayed rap's history through an immersive website.

## Getting Started

Be ready to revive rap's history through this website. No specific action needed, just open index.html in a web browser supporting HTML, CSS & Javascript.

### Prerequisites

A web browser supporting HTML, CSS & JS.

### Installing

Nothing to install.

## Running

Launch index.html. Through this home page you'll be able to learn more on rap's history by scrolling down (or up/down arrow keys) and discovering rap through its origin with important dates, its different types, message and impacts on society. Then dive to hip-hop, the main music style which rap comes from. Once again you will be able to learn more about hip-hop with exactly rap's scheme. Finally, the process is the same for jazz, the music which hip-hop comes from.

## Features

* A fullscreen navigation menu allows you to access directly a music type.


### Break down into end to end tests

For each feature coded, a commit have been sent to the repository for being tested by other team members. While designing the website, we confronted some support and accesibility problems leading us to opt for maximum cross-border coding and better device support. The updates were uploaded online for letting our family and friends to test the website too, and to get their feedbacks.
Nevertheless the website is not responsive.

Here is an example of our tests : Fullscreen navigation menu tests
