# L'Histoire du Rap

L'Histoire du Rap is a project leaded by HETIC students (a well-known french web school), within no more than 10 days. This project have been done as a subject to reflexion on History. According to the creator's, history's problem is how it is learned and accessed. That's why they chose one specific historical subject, rap music, and delayed rap's history through an immersive website.

## Getting Started

Be ready to revive rap's history through this website. No specific action needed, just open index.html in a web browser supporting HTML, CSS & Javascript.

### Prerequisites

A web browser supporting HTML, CSS & JS.

### Installing

Nothing to install.

## Running

Launch index.html. Through this home page you'll be able to learn more on rap's history by scrolling down and discovering rap through its origin with important dates, its different types, message and impacts on society. Then dive to hip-hop, the main music style which rap comes from. Once again you will be able to learn more about hip-hop with exactly rap's scheme. Finally, the process is the same for jazz, the music which hip-hop comes from.
